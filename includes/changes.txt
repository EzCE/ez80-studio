Include conversion script for BASM-3 by beckadamtheinventor: https://github.com/beckadamtheinventor/BASM-3/

The conversion script has been modified to support lowercase letters and the '_' and '.' characters, along with a modified header.
It has also been updated to fix a bug with data size detection.
The original can be found here: https://github.com/beckadamtheinventor/BASM-3/blob/master/data/conv-inc.py

TI84PCEG_smaller.inc, TIOSFLAG.inc, TIOSKBEQ.inc, TIOSRAMA.inc, and TIOSRTNS.inc have all been modified to include updated names
and to fix some symbol definitions.
